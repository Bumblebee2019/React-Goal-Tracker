# Goal Tracker App

In addition to utilizing new React skills that I learned, I also implemented an UUID id for each element in the array. Auto-incremented id's are simpler to implement, but using UUIDs makes this application ready for the challenges of scale, complexity, and reliability. Since my ultimate goal is to become a React developer, I try to use industry-standard practices to solve issues I encounter even in very simple projects.
